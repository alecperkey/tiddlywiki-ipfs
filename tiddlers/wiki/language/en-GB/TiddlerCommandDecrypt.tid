<p>
If the locker is closed your wiki is encrypted or will be encrypted once saved.
</p>
<p>
A password will be requested to unlock your wiki when loaded.
</p>
<p>
External resources are automatically unencrypted when their host Tiddlers are displayed.
</p>
<p>
While unencrypting an external resource, a password could be requested:
</p>
<ul>
<li>When the wiki is unencrypted but its external resource is encrypted</li>
<li>When the wiki is encrypted but the encrypted external resource uses a different password</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>

[[IPFS - Encrypted - The Little Prince]] describes this behaviour.
</p>
<p>
Edit the [[IPFS - Encrypted - The Little Prince]] Tiddler. It has a password field . The password value when used will unencryt the external resource.
