# Ipfs with TiddyWiki
<a name="tiddlywiki-ipfs"/>

```Ipfs with TiddyWiki``` is a TiddlyWiki plugin who aims to help developers, editors or users to save their wikis and attachments over Ipfs.

According to [TiddlyWiki Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TiddlyWiki), `TiddlyWiki is a personal wiki and a non-linear notebook for organising and sharing complex information. It is an open-source single page application wiki in the form of a single HTML file that includes CSS, JavaScript, and the content. It is designed to be easy to customize and re-shape depending on application. It facilitates re-use of content by dividing it into small pieces called Tiddlers.`

TiddlyWiki with Ipfs is a decentralized computer application (DApp, dApp, Dapp, or dapp) that runs on a distributed computing system.

Drag and drop the current [TiddlyWiki with Ipfs plugin](https://bluelightav.eth.link/#%24%3A%2Fplugins%2Fipfs) in your current TiddlyWiki instance.

#### Getting running `Ipfs with TiddlyWiki` in your browser
<a name="running-browser"/>

* Starting from the file system, Follow the developer instructions [Running TiddlyWiki](#developer-running)
* Starting with the latest online version @ https://bluelightav.eth
* * [Metamask for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn)
* * [Metamask for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/ether-metamask/)
* Starting with the latest online version @ https://bluelightav.eth.link
* * [Ipfs Companion for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch)
* * [Ipfs Companion for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/ipfs-companion/)

<b>Remarks:</b>
<br/>
* The https://tiddly.bluelightav.eth.link Url requires Ipfs Companion to be fully resolved as an Ipns indentifier otherwise [EthDNS and EthLink](https://eth.link/) is taking care of your Url. EthLink do not resolve well the https://subdomain.domain.eth.link Url as browsers complain about the Https certificate. This Let's Encrypt valid certificate is a wildcard certificate but too widely opened and considered insecure by major browsers (Tested with Chrome and Firefox). The http://tiddly.bluelightav.eth.link is also available and browsers do not complain however MITM are possible.
* The https://bluelightav.eth.link Url requires requires Ipfs Companion to be fully resolved as an Ipns identifier otherwise [EthDNS and EthLink](https://eth.link/) is taking care of your Url. In that situation browsers do not complain.
* The https://bluelightav.eth Url requires Metamask to be fully resolved as an Ipfs identifier.


#### Running a local Ipfs node with Ipfs Desktop
<a name="ipfs-desktop"/>

* [Ipfs Desktop](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop)

According to the `ipfs-desktop` [README.md](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-desktop/blob/master/README.md), `IPFS Desktop allows you to run your IPFS Node on your machine without having to bother with command line tools`.

Running a local IPFS node server greatly enhance the performance.

#### Use a browser extension with Ipfs Companion
<a name="ipfs-companion"/>

* [Ipfs Companion for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipfs-companion/nibjojkomfdiaoajekhjakgkdhaomnch)
* [Ipfs Companion for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/fr/firefox/addon/ipfs-companion/)

According to the `ipfs-companion` [README.md](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-companion/blob/master/README.md), `This add-on enables everyone to access IPFS resources the way they were meant: from locally running IPFS node :-)`.


## Developer
<a name="developer"/>

We setup a nodejs environment to build a tiddlywiki instance bundled with `Ipfs with TiddlyWiki`.

### Environment
<a name="developer-environment"/>

* [Node.js](#nodejs) - Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
* [Babelify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babelify) - Babel browserify is a tool for compiling node-flavored commonjs modules for the browser.
* [TiddyWiki](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tiddlywiki) -  TiddlyWiki, a non-linear personal web self-contained notebook.
* [Ipfs Provider](https://github.com/ipfs-shipyard/ipfs-provider)
* [Ipfs Http Client](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs-http-client)


#### Node.js
<a name="developer-nodejs"/>


##### Resource
<a name="developer-nodejs-resource"/>

Official Node documentation:
https://nodejs.org/en/docs/

Official npm repository
https://www.npmjs.com/


##### Install
<a name="developer-nodejs-install"/>

On Debian buster we setup a new source list who contains the node 11.x repository addresses.

edit:
```
/etc/apt/source.list.d/nodesource.list
```
input:
```
deb https://deb.nodesource.com/node_11.x buster main
deb-src https://deb.nodesource.com/node_11.x buster main
```
Once our node repository is known, we update and install the latest nodejs 11.x:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs
```


##### Setup
<a name="developer-nodejs-setup"/>

We configure our home environment to host the npm global packages.

Configure npm global directory
```
// directory where npm will install packages
mkdir ~/.npm-global
// configure npm
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'

// following the previous command ~/.npmrc should contain:
prefix=/home/yourHome/.npm-global

// update .profile or .zshrc with
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH

// update your system variables
source ~/.profile or source ~/.zshrc
```

At this stage we can test our node environment:
```
node -v
v11.15.0
```

We update npm to use the latest:
```
npm install -g npm@latest
```
Then we test our npm environment:
```
npm -v
6.11.3
```


#### Repository install
<a name="developer-repository-install"/>

Clone this repository in a local folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/xmaysonnave/tiddlywiki-ipfs --depth 1
```
Change directory:
```
cd tiddlywiki-ipfs
```
Install dependencies, [Node.js](#nodejs) should be installed and setup:
```
npm install
```
We now have a populated node_modules directory.


#### Building TiddlyWiki
<a name="developer-building-tiddlywiki"/>

The repository contains several scripts who build TiddWiki instances bundled with `Ipfs with TiddlyWiki`. The [package.json](https://github.com/xmaysonnave/tiddlywiki-ipfs/blob/master/package.json) references several options:
* prepare
* browserify
* tiddlywiki-ipfs
* tiddlywiki-ipfs-cardo
* all

Use the `all` script to build TiddlyWiki instances. The `ipfs/output` directory should be populated with two directories:
* base
* cardo


#### Running TiddlyWiki
<a name="developer-running"/>

The directories [ipfs/output/base](https://github.com/xmaysonnave/tiddlywiki-ipfs/tree/master/ipfs/output/base) and [ipfs/output/cardo](https://github.com/xmaysonnave/tiddlywiki-ipfs/tree/master/ipfs/output/cardo) contains two files:
* favicon.ico
* index.html

Open an index.html in your favorite browser. The `favicon.ico` is available as a convenience as its content is embedded in the `index.html`.
